# # Write a program that repeatedly reads in positive integer inputs from the user until they indicate they are finished.

# Requirements:

# The program will ask the user to enter a positive integer and validate that input.
# The program will then ask if they would like to enter another number. Anything but "Y" or "y" end can be taken to mean no.
# The program then prints the largest integer that has been entered.
